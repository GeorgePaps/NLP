Here I will collect some of my thoughs on Natural Language Processing.

## 1. Why Study NLP

So why humans study the field of Natural Language Processing?
What's the goal?
On the top of my head I can think of 2 main reasons:

1) Create algorithms that can extract useful content out of text (spoken, written, or whatever).
2) Create algorithms that can intentionally generate text with desired properties.

Maybe a third that comes to my mind is to create a system for a machine to reason.
It seems to me that to some extend we humans use language for thinking,
maybe a similar functionality could be achieved with machines.

An interesting definition of intelligence that I have encountered and I think it is suitable for natural language processing is the following:

> Intelligence: the ability to **perceive** or **deduce** information, **retain** it as knowledge and **apply** it to make decision. 

Maybe that's the intention with natural language processing as well, to create an algorithm that can perceive or deduce information (text), retain it as knowledge and then apply to make decision.

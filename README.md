# NLP

## General Remarks

A repository where I explore Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Although I have some background in machine learning and natural
language processing,
I will try to approach this topic with the eyes of a newcomer. This means thinking and hypothesizing first; reading, learning and applying second.
I believe that this approach can help you in the learning process.
This repository I guess will track part of my learning journey.

## Approach

I will start exploring the topic rather organically,
my approach will evolve along the way.
For time being I will start by exploring this very interesting [repository](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp) and reading [this](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book_jan122022.pdf) and [this](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-PyTorch-Applications/dp/1491978236/) book.
Additionally I would like to start working on some problems,
I'll deal later with that.

## Why

So why humans study the field of Natural Language Processing?
What's the goal?
On the top of my head I can think of 2 main reasons:

1) Create algorithms that can extract useful content out of text (spoken, written, or whatever).
2) Create algorithms that can intentionally generate text with desired properties.

Maybe a third that comes to my mind is to create a system for a machine to reason.
It seems to me that to some extend we humans use language for thinking,
maybe a similar functionality could be achieved with machines.

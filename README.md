# NLP

A repository where I explore Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Although I have some background in machine learning and natural
language processing,
I will try to approach this topic with the eyes of a newcomer. This means thinking and hypothesizing first; reading, learning and applying second.
I believe that this approach can help you in the learning process.
This repository I guess will track part of my learning journey.

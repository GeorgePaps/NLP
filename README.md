# NLP

## General Remarks

A repository where I explore Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Although I have some background in machine learning and natural
language processing,
I will try to approach this topic with the eyes of a newcomer. This means thinking and hypothesizing first; reading, learning and applying second.
I believe that this approach can help  in the learning process.
This repository I guess will track part of my learning journey.

> Thinking and hypothesizing first; reading, learning and applying second.

## Approach

I will start exploring the topic somewhat organically,
my approach will evolve along the way.
For time being I will start by exploring this very interesting [repository](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp) and reading [this](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book_jan122022.pdf) and [this](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-PyTorch-Applications/dp/1491978236/) book. 
Additionally I would like to start working on some problems,
I'll deal later with that.

## What is NLP

According to Natural Language Processing with PyTorch book. 

> NLP refers to a set of techniques involving the application of statistical methods, with ot without insights from linguistics, to understand text for the sake of solving real-world tasks. 
This "understanding" of of text is mainly derived by transforming texts to computational representations, 
which are discrete or continuos combinatorial structures such as vectors or tensors, graphs, and trees.
